## Description

As the head of any team, I would like to be able to input their basic contact info so that I can have easy access to all team memebrs info in the same place. This application allows user to input team  members basic info along with contact info and store it all in one functional page.


## Usage

When the user runs node index.js they will be prompted with a series of questions about team member info, and can provide for as many members as needed before completing the team and the page being completed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](Develop/utils/Screenshot%202023-01-10%20205754.png)
    ```

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
